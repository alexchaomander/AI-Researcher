Abstract 
The pursuit of more intelligent and credible autonomous systems, akin to human society, has been a long-standing 
endeavor for humans. Leveraging the exceptional reasoning and planning capabilities of large language models 
(LLMs), LLM-based agents have been proposed and have achieved remarkable success across a wide array of tasks. 
Notably, LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) are considered a promising pathway towards realizing general artifi-
cial intelligence that is equivalent to or surpasses human-level intelligence. In this paper, we present a comprehensive 
survey of these studies, offering a systematic review of LLM-based MAS. Adhering to the workflow of LLM-based 
multi-agent systems, we synthesize a general structure encompassing five key components: profile, perception, self-
action, mutual interaction, and evolution. This unified framework encapsulates much of the previous work in the field. 
Furthermore, we illuminate the extensive applications of LLM-based MAS in two principal areas: problem-solving 
and world simulation. Finally, we discuss in detail several contemporary challenges and provide insights into potential 
future directions in this domain.

1 Introduction
Enhancing the reliability and intelligence of autonomous 
intelligent systems has long been regarded as a highly 
promising research avenue. With the advent of the agent 
concept, which refers to an entity capable of perceiving 
its environment and taking action, agent-based intel -
ligent systems have garnered considerable attention in 
recent years. Historically, RL-based intelligent systems 
have dominated this field, wherein agents are typically 
assigned to perform simple, well-defined actions or tasks 
with constraint interaction with their environment. How-
ever, this approach has inherent limitations in terms of 
adaptability and complexity, prompting the exploration 
of more advanced and interactive agent-based systems.
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated 
exceptional potential in reasoning and planning, aligning 
precisely with the human expectations for LLM-based 
agents capable of perceiving their surroundings, mak -
ing decisions, and taking actions within an interactive 
environment. Motivated by this, LLM-based agents have 
made significant strides in interacting with complex envi-
ronments and solving intricate tasks across a wide range 
of applications [1], akin to human life in society. Notably, 
LLM-based multi-agent systems have been proposed as 
a pivotal pathway to harness collective intelligence while 
preserving the specialized characteristics of individual 
agents, thereby advancing toward more sophisticated 
autonomous intelligent systems. Specifically, multiple 
specialized agents, endowed with distinct identiti
