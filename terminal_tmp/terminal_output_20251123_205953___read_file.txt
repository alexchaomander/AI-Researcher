Abstract
Human beings capable of making and using tools can accomplish tasks far beyond their innate abilities, and this paradigm of 
integration with tools may not be limited to humans themselves. Recently, the large language model (LLM) has demonstrated 
immense potential across various fields with its unique planning and reasoning abilities. However, there are still many chal-
lenges beyond its capabilities due to deficiencies in its training data and inherent illusions. Thus, integrating LLMs and tools 
into tool learning agents has become a new emerging research direction. To this end, we present a systematic investigation 
and comprehensive review of tool-learning agents in this paper. We start by introducing the definition of the tool learning 
task for Agents and then illustrating the  typical architecture of the tool-learning models. Since these tools are all defined by 
users, LLM does not know what tools there are and what their functions are. Thus, LLMs should first find appropriate tools 
and split the tool retrieval methods into two categories: training-based and non-training-based. To accurately complete the 
user task, it is important to decompose the task into several sub-tasks and execute them in the correct order. Following that, 
we introduce the tool planning methods and organize these works by whether they rely on the model’s inherent reasoning 
capabilities for planning or utilize external reasoning tools. Due to the rapid development of this field, we also introduce 
an emerging frontier direction: using multimodal tools for LLM. In addition, we compile current open-source benchmarks 
and evaluation metrics, focusing on their scale, composition, calculation methods, and assessment dimensions. Next, we 
introduce several application scenarios for the LLM-based tool learning methods. Finally, we discuss the safety and ethical 
issues involved in tool learning.

1 Introduction
Tool- learning is considered a unique ability of humans [4]. 
The innovation and application of tools expand the range of 
available resources, empowering humans to overcome physi-
ological limitations and enhancing problem-solving effi-
ciency [37]. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated impressive 
abilities in reasoning and comprehension. There is a growing 
interest in their potential to interact with the real world and 
enhance their functionality through integration with external 
tools. Inspired by human tool learning, the integration of 
tool-learning capabilities into LLMs has received extensive 
attention in the literature. The goal of tool learning is to 
empower LLMs to understand the functionality of various 
tools and employ them effectively to accomplish specific 
tasks.
The integration of multiple inputs, multi-agent planning 
strategies and reasoning frameworks, along with diverse 
tool repositories, facilitates the development of tool learning 
capabilities within LLMs. Thus, equipping LLMs with tools 
has become a new emerging research direction. Currently, 
research primarily focuses on two approaches for integrating 
LLMs with tools. The first approach focuses on empowering 
LLMs to master the use and application of tools, thereby 
enhancing LLMs intelligence. The second approach endeav-
ors to view tools as extensions of LLMs inherent capabili-
ties. The two approaches share the same three steps to aug-
ment LLMs with tools: invoking tools at the right time, 
retrieving the appropriate tools, and effectively utilizing 
them to solve real-world tasks. However, each of the three 
steps in tool-learning presents several challenges: (1) LLMs
