<span id='quick-start'/>

## ⚡ Quick Start

**Lightweight macOS setup (recommended)**

- Create and activate a virtual env: `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
- Install the trimmed dependency set: `pip install -e .` (add `.[full]` for optional extras or `.[dev]` for tooling). The tree-sitter grammar for Python is bundled via `tree_sitter_languages`; no manual build needed.
- Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and fill in your API keys (`COMPLETION_MODEL`, `CHEEP_MODEL`, OpenRouter `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`, GitHub token, etc.). If you’re using OpenRouter, set `OPENROUTER_API_BASE=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` (already defaulted if present). The default embedding model now targets OpenRouter’s `qwen/qwen3-embedding-8b`; override via `EMBEDDING_MODEL` as needed.
- For fully local embeddings with Ollama, set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` (default `http://localhost:11434`). When that endpoint is present, the runtime automatically routes embeddings to Ollama and defaults `EMBEDDING_MODEL` to `embeddinggemma:latest`. Without OpenRouter or Ollama configured, the fallback embedding model is `text-embedding-3-small`.
- Run a quick smoke check: `python -m research_agent.inno.cli --help` (or `python web_ai_researcher.py` after installing `.[full]` for the Gradio UI)
- Bring your own data: configs live in `benchmark/final/`; datasets and media are intentionally not bundled to keep the repo light.

<span id='examples'/>

## ⬇️ Examples

This lightweight fork keeps the repository small enough to clone and run on a typical macOS laptop. We removed the large GIF/MP4/PDF demo artifacts that used to live under `examples/`; you can view full demo media on the [project page](https://autoresearcher.github.io) or by pulling the original upstream release if you need them locally.

If you want to try the system end-to-end, point it at the benchmark configs in `benchmark/final/` (or your own JSON tasks) and provide your own working directory for outputs. The agents no longer assume any bundled datasets—bring your own data or wire up the paths in your config.
