# Inno-Bench: Benchmarking System-Level AI-Researcher with Expert-Level Ground Truth

This lightweight workspace drops the raw datasets and cached evaluation artifacts that used to live under `benchmark/process` to keep the repository small. The JSON task definitions in `benchmark/final/` remain for running agents; supply your own datasets or regenerate the larger artifacts if you need them.
